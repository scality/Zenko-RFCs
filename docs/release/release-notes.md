# Release Notes

Releasing a new version requires tracking and publishing notes of changes.
All changes are tracked in a changelog.

## Tooling

Open source project [changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie) can be used to manage a changelog without merge conflicts or strict magic commit messages.
This would allow us to add release notes at the time of the change in preparation for a later release.
Changie is also built with CI/CD in mind so it should be no problem to integrate with existing systems.

## Writing

Gitlab has a similar tool and created a guide [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/changelog.html#writing-good-changelog-entries).
Changelog entries can also be reviewed while context is fresh.
