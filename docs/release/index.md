# Object Squad Release Process

This is the official documentation for how the Object Squad will handle releases.

We expect this release process will:

* Give us a simpler, more conventional release workflow.
* Speed our development, improving code-complete-to-GA time and end-to-end test feedback.
* Enable us to release more and smaller.
* Untangle our projects and enable us to manage them independently.
* Reduce the stress around releases.
