Requirements

## Structure of this repository

This repository contains requirements and design for Scality S3 and Zenko.
They follow a template:

- Clear title and lowercase-dashed name
- An overview that contains a description of the problem that we
  want to solve
- One or more use cases, with a clear mention of the actors in each
  use case
- Then a detailed description of the technical implementation
- A review of alternative approaches to solve the
  problem. This will show that the proposal has been analyzed at depth
  (think of this as bibliographic reference)

## How to add a spec

Anybody can add a spec: clone the repository,
create a copy of the file TEMPLATE.md and submit a pull request
with your proposal. The PR will be reviewed by Zenko team.
